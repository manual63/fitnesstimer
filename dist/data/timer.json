    "description":"<p>A little about myself and my web development background. In the mid 90's I started working on building websites for a bicycle shop I worked for. I purchased a couple of HTML and JavaScript books and learned how to hand code websites right away. By 1999 I was working full time as a web developer doing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My web development career was born.</p><p>I enjoy working on the front end, although I have some back end experience in Java and PHP with a solid understanding of databases and SQL. I put most of my focus on the front end and polishing my knowledge base on all languages related to it.</p><p>Whether it's mobile web applications, responsive design, or the latest CSS3 tricks, I have the experience needed to tackle them. I am also experienced in cross-browser compliance as I have been working with a wide variety of browsers since 1995.</p><p>"
